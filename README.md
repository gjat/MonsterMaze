The player ("P") has to get from the top left corner, to the bottom right of the maze (the exit).   At the same time, one or more monsters ("M") chase the player.   The player must avoid the monster and not get caught.

There are three levels, with each level adding an additional monster, to increase difficulty.

To run, fetch the code and then ```dotnet build; dotnet run``` within a command prompt or powershell window.
